# Choose a Connection Target

## Overview

In this guide, you can learn how to use a connection string and `MongoClient` object to connect to different types of MongoDB deployments.

## Atlas

To connect to a MongoDB deployment on Atlas, include the following elements in your connection string:

- URL of your Atlas cluster

- MongoDB username

- MongoDB password

Then, pass your connection string to the `MongoClient` constructor.

Follow the [Atlas driver connection guide](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/driver-connection/) to retrieve your connection string.

When you connect to Atlas, we recommend using the Stable API client option to avoid breaking changes when Atlas upgrades to a new version of MongoDB Server. To learn more about the Stable API feature, see the [Stable API page](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/languages/python/pymongo-driver/connect/connection-options/stable-api/#std-label-pymongo-stable-api).

The following code shows how to use PyMongo to connect to an Atlas cluster. The code also uses the `server_api` option to specify a Stable API version. Select the Synchronous or Asynchronous tab to see the corresponding code:

<Tabs>

<Tab name="Synchronous">

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
from pymongo.server_api import ServerApi

# Replace the placeholder with your Atlas connection string
uri = "<connection string>"

# Create a MongoClient with a MongoClientOptions object to set the Stable API version
client = MongoClient(uri, server_api=ServerApi(
    version='1', strict=True, deprecation_errors=True))

try:
    # Connect the client to the server (optional starting in v4.7)
    client.connect()

    # Send a ping to confirm a successful connection
    client.admin.command({'ping': 1})
    print("Pinged your deployment. You successfully connected to MongoDB!")

finally:
    # Ensures that the client will close when you finish/error
    client.close()

```

</Tab>

<Tab name="Asynchronous">

```python
import asyncio
from pymongo import AsyncMongoClient
from pymongo.server_api import ServerApi

async def main():
    # Replace the placeholder with your Atlas connection string
    uri = "<connection string>"

    # Create a MongoClient with a MongoClientOptions object to set the Stable API version
    client = AsyncMongoClient(uri, server_api=ServerApi(
        version='1', strict=True, deprecation_errors=True))

    try:
        # Send a ping to confirm a successful connection
        await client.admin.command({'ping': 1})
        print("Pinged your deployment. You successfully connected to MongoDB!")

    finally:
        # Ensures that the client will close when you finish/error
        await client.close()

asyncio.run(main())
```

</Tab>

## Local Deployments

To connect to a local MongoDB deployment, use `localhost` as the hostname. By default, the `mongod` process runs on port 27017, though you can customize this for your deployment.

The following code shows how to use PyMongo to connect to a local MongoDB deployment. Select the Synchronous or Asynchronous tab to see the corresponding code:

<Tabs>

<Tab name="Synchronous">

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient

uri = "mongodb://localhost:27017/"
client = MongoClient(uri)
```

</Tab>

<Tab name="Asynchronous">

```python
from pymongo import AsyncMongoClient

uri = "mongodb://localhost:27017/"
client = AsyncMongoClient(uri)
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

## Replica Sets

To connect to a replica set, specify the hostnames (or IP addresses) and port numbers of the replica-set members in your connection string.

The following code shows how to use PyMongo to connect to a replica set that contains three hosts. Select the Synchronous or Asynchronous tab to see the corresponding code:

<Tabs>

<Tab name="Synchronous">

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient

client = MongoClient("mongodb://host1:27017,host2:27017,host3:27017")
```

</Tab>

<Tab name="Asynchronous">

```python
from pymongo import AsyncMongoClient

client = AsyncMongoClient("mongodb://host1:27017,host2:27017,host3:27017")
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

If you aren't able to provide a full list of hosts in the replica set, you can specify one or more of the hosts in the replica set and instruct PyMongo to perform automatic discovery to find the others. To instruct the driver to perform automatic discovery, perform one of the following actions:

- Specify the name of the replica set as the value of the `replicaSet` parameter.

- Specify `false` as the value of the `directConnection` parameter.

- Specify more than one host in the replica set.

In the following example, the driver uses a sample connection URI to connect to the MongoDB replica set `sampleRS`, which is running on port `27017` of three different hosts, including `host1`. Select the Synchronous or Asynchronous tab to see the corresponding code:

<Tabs>

<Tab name="Synchronous">

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient

uri = "mongodb://host1:27017/?replicaSet=sampleRS"
client = MongoClient(uri)
```

</Tab>

<Tab name="Asynchronous">

```python
from pymongo import AsyncMongoClient

uri = "mongodb://host1:27017/?replicaSet=sampleRS"
client = AsyncMongoClient(uri)
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

When a replica set runs in Docker, it might expose only one MongoDB endpoint. In this case, the replica set is not discoverable. Specifying `directConnection=false` in your connection URI, or leaving this option unset, can prevent your application from connecting to it.

In a test or development environment, you can connect to the replica set by specifying `directConnection=true`. In a production environment, we recommend configuring the cluster to make each MongoDB instance accessible outside of the Docker virtual network.

PyMongo evenly load balances operations across deployments that are reachable within the client's `localThresholdMS` value. To learn more about how PyMongo load balances operations across multiple MongoDB deployments, see the [Customize Server Selection](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/languages/python/pymongo-driver/connect/connection-options/server-selection/#std-label-pymongo-server-selection) guide.

The `MongoClient` constructor is *non-blocking*. When you connect to a replica set, the constructor returns immediately while the client uses background threads to connect to the replica set.

If you construct a `MongoClient` and immediately print the string representation of its `nodes` attribute, the list might be empty while the client connects to the replica-set members.

### Initialization

To initialize a replica set, you must connect directly to a single member. To do so, set the `directConnection` connection option to `True`. You can do this in two ways: by passing an argument to the `MongoClient` constructor or through a parameter in your connection string.

<Tabs>

<Tab name="MongoClient">

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient

client = MongoClient("mongodb://<hostname>:<port>",
                     directConnection=True)
```

</Tab>

<Tab name="Connection String">

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient

uri = ("mongodb://<hostname>:<port>/?"
       "directConnection=true")
client = MongoClient(uri)
```

</Tab>

<Tab name="MongoClient (Asynchronous)">

```python
from pymongo import AsyncMongoClient

client = AsyncMongoClient("mongodb://<hostname>:<port>",
                           directConnection=True)
```

</Tab>

<Tab name="Connection String (Asynchronous)">

```python
from pymongo import AsyncMongoClient

uri = ("mongodb://<hostname>:<port>/?"
       "directConnection=true")
client = AsyncMongoClient(uri)
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

## DNS Service Discovery

To use DNS service discovery to look up the DNS SRV record of the service you're connecting to, specify the SRV connection format in your connection string. Additionally, if you enable the SRV connection format, PyMongo automatically re-scans for new hosts without having to change the client configuration.

The following code shows a connection string that uses the SRV connection format:

```python
uri = "mongodb+srv://<hostname>/"
```

To learn more about the SRV connection format, see the [SRV Connection Format](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/#std-label-connections-dns-seedlist) entry in the MongoDB Server manual.

## Troubleshooting

### Server Reports Wire Version X, PyMongo Requires Y

If you try to connect to MongoDB Server v3.6 or earlier, PyMongo might raise the following error:

```
pymongo.errors.ConfigurationError: Server at localhost:27017 reports wire version 6, but this version of PyMongo requires at least 7 (MongoDB 4.0).
```

This occurs when the driver version is too new for the server it's connecting to. To resolve this issue, you can do one of the following:

- Upgrade your MongoDB deployment to v4.0 or later.

- Downgrade to PyMongo 4.10 or earlier, which supports MongoDB Server v3.6 and later.

- Downgrade to PyMongo v3.x, which supports MongoDB Server v2.6 and later.

### AutoReconnect

An `AutoReconnect` exception indicates that a [failover](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/glossary/#std-term-failover) has occurred. This means that PyMongo has lost its connection to the original primary member of the replica set, and its last operation might have failed.

When this error occurs, PyMongo automatically tries to find the new primary member for subsequent operations. To handle the error, your application must take one of the following actions:

- Retry the operation that might have failed

- Continue running, with the understanding that the operation might have failed

PyMongo raises an `AutoReconnect` error on all operations until the replica set elects a new primary member.

### Timeout When Accessing MongoDB from PyMongo with Tunneling

If you try to connect to a MongoDB replica set over an SSH tunnel, you receive the following error:

```python
File "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/pymongo/collection.py", line 1560, in count
  return self._count(cmd, collation, session)
  File "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/pymongo/collection.py", line 1504, in _count
  with self._socket_for_reads() as (connection, slave_ok):
  File "/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/contextlib.py", line 17, in __enter__
  return self.gen.next()
  File "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/pymongo/mongo_client.py", line 982, in _socket_for_reads
  server = topology.select_server(read_preference)
  File "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/pymongo/topology.py", line 224, in select_server
  address))
  File "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/pymongo/topology.py", line 183, in select_servers
  selector, server_timeout, address)
  File "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/pymongo/topology.py", line 199, in _select_servers_loop
  self._error_message(selector))
pymongo.errors.ServerSelectionTimeoutError: localhost:27017: timed out
```

This occurs because PyMongo discovers replica set members by using the response from the `isMaster` command, which contains the addresses and ports of the other replica set members. However, you can't access these addresses and ports through the SSH tunnel.

Instead, you can connect directly to a single MongoDB node by using the `directConnection=True` option with SSH tunneling.
