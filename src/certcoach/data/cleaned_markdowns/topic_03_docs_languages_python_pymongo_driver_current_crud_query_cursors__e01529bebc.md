# Access Data From a Cursor

## Overview

In this guide, you can learn how to access data from a **cursor** with PyMongo.

A cursor is a mechanism that returns the results of a read operation in iterable batches. Because a cursor holds only a subset of documents at any given time, cursors reduce both memory consumption and network bandwidth usage.

Whenever PyMongo performs a read operation that returns multiple documents, it automatically returns those documents in a cursor.

### Sample Data

The examples in this guide use the `sample_restaurants.restaurants` collection from the Atlas sample datasets. To learn how to create a free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see the Get Started with PyMongo tutorial.

## Access Cursor Contents Iteratively

To iterate over the contents of a cursor, use a `for` loop, as shown in the following example. Select the Synchronous or Asynchronous tab to see the corresponding code:

<Tabs>

<Tab name="Synchronous">

```python
results = collection.find()

for document in results:
    print(document)
```

</Tab>

<Tab name="Asynchronous">

```python
results = collection.find()

async for document in results:
    print(document)
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

## Retrieve Documents Individually

Retrieve documents from a cursor individually by calling the `next()` method.

The following example finds all documents in a collection with a `name` value of `"Dunkin' Donuts"`. It then prints the first document in the cursor by calling the `next()` method. Select the Synchronous or Asynchronous tab to see the corresponding code:

<Tabs>

<Tab name="Synchronous">

```python
results = collection.find({ "name": "Dunkin' Donuts" })

print(results.next())
```

```
{'_id': ObjectId('...'), 'address': { ... }, 'borough': 'Bronx', 'cuisine': 'Donuts', 'grades': [...], 'name': "Dunkin' Donuts", 'restaurant_id': '40379573'}
```

</Tab>

<Tab name="Asynchronous">

```python
results = collection.find({ "name": "Dunkin' Donuts" })

print(await results.next())
```

```
{'_id': ObjectId('...'), 'address': { ... }, 'borough': 'Bronx', 'cuisine': 'Donuts', 'grades': [...], 'name': "Dunkin' Donuts", 'restaurant_id': '40379573'}
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

## Retrieve All Documents

If the number and size of documents returned by your query exceeds available application memory, your program will crash. If you expect a large result set, access your cursor iteratively.

To retrieve all documents from a cursor, convert the cursor into a `list`, as shown in the following example. Select the Synchronous or Asynchronous tab to see the corresponding code:

<Tabs>

<Tab name="Synchronous">

```python
results = collection.find({ "name": "Dunkin' Donuts" })

all_results = list(results)

for document in all_results:
    print(document)
```

</Tab>

<Tab name="Asynchronous">

```python
results = collection.find({ "name": "Dunkin' Donuts" })

all_results = await to_list(results)

for document in all_results:
    print(document)
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

## Close a Cursor

By default, MongoDB closes a cursor when the client has exhausted all the results in the cursor. To explicitly close a cursor, call the `close()` method as shown in the following example. Select the Synchronous or Asynchronous tab to see the corresponding code:

<Tabs>

<Tab name="Synchronous">

```
results = collection.find()

...

results.close()
```

</Tab>

<Tab name="Asynchronous">

```
results = collection.find()

...

await results.close()
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

You can also instantiate a cursor in a `with` statement, as shown in the following example. PyMongo automatically closes the cursor when the block terminates.

```python
with collection.find() as cursor:
    for document in cursor:
        print(document)
```

## Tailable Cursors

When querying on a capped collection, you can use a **tailable cursor** that remains open after the client exhausts the results in a cursor. To create a tailable cursor with capped collection, specify `CursorType.TAILABLE_AWAIT` in the `cursor_type` option of a `find()` method.

The following example uses a tailable cursor to tail the oplog of a replica-set member. Select the Synchronous or Asynchronous tab to see the corresponding code:

<Tabs>

<Tab name="Synchronous">

```python
oplog = client.local.oplog.rs
first = oplog.find().sort('$natural', pymongo.ASCENDING).limit(-1).next()
print(first)
ts = first['ts']

while True:
    cursor = oplog.find({'ts': {'$gt': ts}},
                        cursor_type=pymongo.CursorType.TAILABLE_AWAIT)
    while cursor.alive:
        for doc in cursor:
            ts = doc['ts']
            print(doc)

        # You end up here if the find() method returns no documents, or if
        # no new documents are added to the collection for more than 1 second.
        time.sleep(1)
```

</Tab>

<Tab name="Asynchronous">

```python
oplog = client.local.oplog.rs
first = await oplog.find().sort('$natural', pymongo.ASCENDING).limit(-1).next()
print(first)
ts = first['ts']

while True:
    cursor = oplog.find({'ts': {'$gt': ts}},
                        cursor_type=pymongo.CursorType.TAILABLE_AWAIT)
    while cursor.alive:
        async for doc in cursor:
            ts = doc['ts']
            print(doc)

        # You end up here if the find() method returns no documents, or if
        # no new documents are added to the collection for more than 1 second.
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
```

</Tab>

## Troubleshooting

### 'Cursor' Object Has No Attribute '_Cursor__killed'

PyMongo v3.8 or earlier raises a `TypeError` and an `AttributeError` if you supply invalid arguments to the `Cursor` constructor. The `AttributeError` is irrelevant, but the `TypeError` contains debugging information as shown in the following example:

```
Exception ignored in: <function Cursor.__del__ at 0x1048129d8>
...
AttributeError: 'Cursor' object has no attribute '_Cursor__killed'
...
TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument '<argument>'
```

To fix this, ensure that you supply the correct keyword arguments. You can also upgrade to PyMongo v3.9 or later, which removes the irrelevant error.

### "*CursorNotFound* cursor id not valid at server"

Cursors in MongoDB can timeout on the server if they've been open for a long time without any operations being performed on them. This can lead to a `CursorNotFound` exception when you try to iterate through the cursor.
