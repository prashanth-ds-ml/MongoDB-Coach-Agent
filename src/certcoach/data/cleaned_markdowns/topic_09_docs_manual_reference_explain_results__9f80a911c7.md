# Explain Results

To return information on query plans and execution statistics of the query plans, MongoDB provides the following methods:

- `db.collection.explain()`

- `cursor.explain()`

To learn about important explain result fields and how to interpret them, see Interpret Explain Plan Results.

`explain` ignores the plan cache. Instead, a set of candidate plans are generated, and a winner is chosen without consulting the plan cache. Furthermore, `explain` prevents the MongoDB query planner from caching the winning plan.

Only the most important output fields are shown on this page, and fields for internal use are not documented. The fields listed in the output are subject to change.

## Explain Output Structure

The `explain` results present the query plans as a tree of stages. The output structure can differ based on which query engine the operation uses. Operations can use the classic query engine or the slot-based execution query engine.

To see how the output structure can differ between the two execution engines, see the following examples:

<Tabs>

<Tab name="Classic Execution Engine">

```javascript
winningPlan: {
   stage: <STAGE1>,
   ...
   inputStage: {
      stage: <STAGE2>,
      ...
      inputStage: {
         stage: <STAGE3>,
         ...
      }
   }
},
```

</Tab>

<Tab name="Slot-based Execution Engine">

```javascript
winningPlan: {
   queryPlan: {
      stage: <STAGE1>,
      ...
      inputStage: {
         stage: <STAGE2>,
         ...
         inputStage: {
            stage: <STAGE3>,
            ...
         }
      }
   }
   slotBasedPlan: {
      ...
   }
},
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

Each stage passes its resulting documents or index keys to the parent node. The leaf nodes access the collection or the indices. The internal nodes use the documents or the index keys that result from the child nodes. The root node indicates the stage that MongoDB ultimately derives the result set from.

Stages are descriptive of the operation. For example:

- `COLLSCAN` for a collection scan

- `IXSCAN` for scanning index keys

- `FETCH` for retrieving documents

- `GROUP` for grouping documents

- `SHARD_MERGE` for merging results from shards

- `SHARDING_FILTER` for filtering out orphan documents from shards

- `TS_MODIFY` for modifying a time series collection

- `BATCHED_DELETE` for multiple document deletions that are batched together internally (starting in MongoDB 6.1)

- `EOF` for when a stage is end-of-stream

- `EXPRESS` stages for a limited set of queries that can bypass regular query planning to use optimized index scan plans *(New in version 8.0.)*

  `EXPRESS` stages can be one of the following:

  - `EXPRESS_CLUSTERED_IXSCAN`

  - `EXPRESS_DELETE`

  - `EXPRESS_IXSCAN`

  - `EXPRESS_UPDATE`

## Explain Output for MongoDB 5.1 and Later

This section shows the `explain` output for MongoDB 5.1 and later. To see the explain output for older versions of MongoDB, refer to the documentation for that version.

`explain.explainVersion`
Integer field.

`explainVersion` is the output format version for the plan, such as `"1"` or `"2"`.

### `queryPlanner`

`explain.queryPlanner` information details the plan selected by the query optimizer.

These examples may combine the output structures of MongoDB's classic and slot-based execution engines. They are not meant to be representative. Your output may differ significantly.

<Tabs>

<Tab name="Unsharded Collections">

For unsharded collections, `explain` returns the following `queryPlanner` information:

```javascript
queryPlanner: {
   namespace: <string>,
   indexFilterSet: <boolean>,
   parsedQuery: {
      ...
   },
   planCacheShapeHash: <hexadecimal string>,
   planCacheKey: <hexadecimal string>,
   maxIndexedOrSolutionsReached: <boolean>,
   maxIndexedAndSolutionsReached: <boolean>,
   maxScansToExplodeReached: <boolean>,
   winningPlan: {
     stage: <STAGE1>,
     type: <string>,
     inputStage: {
       stage: <string>,
       ...
     }
   },
   rejectedPlans: [
     <candidate plan1>,
   ]
}
```

Starting in MongoDB 8.0, the existing `queryHash` field is duplicated in a new field named `planCacheShapeHash`. If you're using an earlier MongoDB version, you'll only see the `queryHash` field. Future MongoDB versions will remove the deprecated `queryHash` field, and you'll need to use the `planCacheShapeHash` field instead.

</Tab>

<Tab name="Sharded Collections">

For sharded collections, `explain` includes the core query planner and server information for each accessed shard in the `shards` field:

```javascript
{
   queryPlanner: {
      mongosPlannerVersion: <int>
      winningPlan: {
         stage: <STAGE1>,
         type: <string>,
         shards: [
         {
            shardName: <string>,
            connectionString: <string>,
            serverInfo: {
               ...
            },
            namespace: <string>,
            indexFilterSet: <boolean>,
            parsedQuery: {
               ...
            },
            querySettings: {
               ...
            },
            planCacheShapeHash: <hexadecimal string>,
            planCacheKey: <hexadecimal string>,
            maxIndexedOrSolutionsReached: <boolean>,
            maxIndexedAndSolutionsReached: <boolean>,
            maxScansToExplodeReached: <boolean>,
            winningPlan: {
               stage: <STAGE1>,
               type: <string>,
               inputStage: {
                  stage: <string>,
                  ...
               }
            },
            rejectedPlans: [
              <candidate plan1>,
            ]
         }
         ]
      }
   }
}
```

Starting in MongoDB 8.0, the existing `queryHash` field is duplicated in a new field named `planCacheShapeHash`. If you're using an earlier MongoDB version, you'll only see the `queryHash` field. Future MongoDB versions will remove the deprecated `queryHash` field, and you'll need to use the `planCacheShapeHash` field instead.

</Tab>

</Tabs>

`explain.queryPlanner`
Contains information on the selection of the query plan by the query optimizer.

`explain.queryPlanner.namespace`
A string that specifies the namespace with the names of the database and the collection accessed by the query. The namespace has the format `<database>.<collection>`.

`explain.queryPlanner.indexFilterSet`
A boolean that specifies whether MongoDB applied an index filter for the plan cache query shape.

`explain.queryPlanner.querySettings`
If query settings are set, `querySettings` contains details about the query settings that are applied to the query shape.

To add query settings and explore examples, which include `explain()` output with `querySettings`, see `setQuerySettings`.

`explain.queryPlanner.planCacheShapeHash`
Starting in MongoDB 8.0, the existing `queryHash` field is duplicated in a new field named `planCacheShapeHash`. If you're using an earlier MongoDB version, you'll only see the `queryHash` field. Future MongoDB versions will remove the deprecated `queryHash` field, and you'll need to use the `planCacheShapeHash` field instead.

A hexadecimal string that represents the hash of the plan cache query shape and is dependent only on the plan cache query shapes. `planCacheShapeHash` can help identify slow queries (including the query filter of write operations) with the same plan cache query shape.

As with any hash function, two different plan cache query shapes may result in the same hash value. However, the occurrence of hash collisions between different plan cache query shapes is unlikely.

For more information on `planCacheShapeHash` and `planCacheKey`, see planCacheShapeHash and planCacheKey.

`explain.queryPlanner.planCacheKey`
A hash of the key for the plan cache entry associated with the query.

Unlike the `explain.queryPlanner.planCacheShapeHash`, the `explain.queryPlanner.planCacheKey` is a function of both the plan cache query shape and the currently available indexes for that shape. Specifically, if indexes that can support the query shape are added or dropped, the `planCacheKey` value may change but the `planCacheShapeHash` value wouldn't change.

For more information on `planCacheShapeHash` and `planCacheKey`, see planCacheShapeHash and planCacheKey.

`explain.queryPlanner.optimizationTimeMillis`
Time in milliseconds the query planner spent on query optimization. This result doesn't include time spent optimizing inner `$lookup` queries.

`explain.queryPlanner.optimizedPipeline`
A boolean that indicates that the entire aggregation pipeline operation was optimized away, and instead, fulfilled by a tree of query plan execution stages.

For example, the following aggregation operation can be fulfilled by the tree of query plan execution rather than using the aggregation pipeline.

```javascript
db.example.aggregate([ { $match: { someFlag: true } } ] )
```

The field is only present if the value is `true` and only applies to explain on aggregation pipeline operations. When `true`, because the pipeline was optimized away, no aggregation stage information appears in the output.

`explain.queryPlanner.winningPlan`
A document that details the plan selected by the query optimizer.

`explain.queryPlanner.winningPlan.stage`
A string that denotes the name of the stage.

Each stage consists of information specific to the stage. For example, an `IXSCAN` stage includes the index bounds along with other data specific to the index scan. If a stage has a child stage or multiple child stages, the stage will have an `inputStage` or `inputStages`.

This field appears if the operation used the classic query execution engine.

`explain.queryPlanner.winningPlan.type`
If `stage` is set to `"EOF"`, `type` is a string that denotes the reason for the EOF stage:

- `"nonExistentNamespace"`: indicates the query namespace does not exist.

- `"predicateEvalsToFalse"`: indicates that expression simplification determines that the query will not match any documents.

`explain.queryPlanner.winningPlan.inputStage`
A document that describes the child stage, which provides the documents or index keys to its parent. The field is present *if* the parent stage has only one child.

`explain.queryPlanner.winningPlan.inputStages`
An array of documents describing the child stages. Child stages provide the documents or index keys to the parent stage. The field is present *if* the parent stage has multiple child nodes. For example, stages for $or expressions might consume input from multiple sources.

This field appears if the operation used the classic query execution engine.

`explain.queryPlanner.winningPlan.isCached`
A boolean that indicates if the winningPlan is in the plan cache.

This field is `true` for a maximum of one plan between the winning plan and the rejected plans. If the query has no cached plan, the field is `false` for the winning plan and the rejected plans.

`explain.queryPlanner.winningPlan.queryPlan`
A document that details the plan selected by the query optimizer. MongoDB presents the plan as a tree of stages.

This document appears if the query used the slot-based execution query engine.

`explain.queryPlanner.winningPlan.queryPlan.stage`
A string that denotes the name of the stage.

Each stage consists of information specific to the stage. For example, an `IXSCAN` stage includes the index bounds along with other data specific to the index scan.

`explain.queryPlanner.winningPlan.queryPlan.type`
If `stage` is set to `"EOF"`, `type` is a string that denotes the reason for the EOF stage:

- `"nonExistentNamespace"`: indicates the query namespace does not exist.

- `"predicateEvalsToFalse"`: indicates that expression simplification determines that the query will not match any documents.

`explain.queryPlanner.winningPlan.queryPlan.planNodeId`
Unique integer field that identifies each stage in the execution plan. Field is included in all stages throughout the `explain` results.

`explain.queryPlanner.winningPlan.queryPlan.inputStage`
See `explain.queryPlanner.winningPlan.inputStage`.

`explain.queryPlanner.winningPlan.slotBasedPlan`
Document with information about the slot-based query execution plan tree and stages. **For internal use by MongoDB.**

`explain.queryPlanner.winningPlan.slotBasedPlan.stages`
String that includes information on each stage in the slot-based query execution plan, including execution order, operations, and slot assignments. **For internal use by MongoDB.**

Starting in MongoDB 8.0, if a query uses block processing, `block_to_row` and `ts_bucket_to_cellblock` appear in the `stages` output.

`explain.queryPlanner.rejectedPlans`
Array of candidate plans considered and rejected by the query optimizer. The array can be empty if there were no other candidate plans.

Rejected plans have the same fields as `explain.queryPlanner.winningPlan`.

Starting in MongoDB 8.0, rejected query plans only contain the `find` portion of the query. In previous versions, rejected plans can contain aggregation stages like `$group`. Those aggregation stages aren't used by the query planner to choose the winning plan, so the `rejectedPlans` field only contains the portion of the query that was used to choose the winning plan.

### `executionStats`

The returned `explain.executionStats` information details the execution of the winning plan. In order to include `executionStats` in the results, you must run the explain in either:

- executionStats or

- allPlansExecution verbosity mode. Use `allPlansExecution` mode to include partial execution data captured during plan selection.

These examples may combine the output structures of MongoDB's classic and slot-based execution engines. They are not meant to be representative. Your output may differ significantly.

`explain.executionStats`
Contains statistics that describe the completed query execution for the winning plan. For write operations, completed query execution refers to the modifications that *would* be performed, but does *not* apply the modifications to the database.

`explain.executionStats.nReturned`
Number of documents returned by the winning query plan. `nReturned` corresponds to the `n` field returned by `cursor.explain()` in earlier versions of MongoDB.

`explain.executionStats.executionTimeMillis`
Total time in milliseconds required for query plan selection and query execution. It includes the time it takes to run the trial phase part of the plan selection process, but does not include the network time to transmit the data back to the client.

The time reported by `explain.executionStats.executionTimeMillis` is not necessarily representative of actual query time. During steady state operations (when the query plan is cached), or when using `cursor.hint()` with `cursor.explain()`, MongoDB bypasses the plan selection process, resulting in a faster actual time, leading to a lower `explain.executionStats.executionTimeMillis` value.

`explain.executionStats.peakTrackedMemBytes`
Maximum number of bytes of tracked memory in use by the current query operation.

The explain execution statistics provide the peak memory for the entire query and also for each blocking stage. If there is only one blocking stage, the query and stage `peakTrackedMemBytes` values are the same.

`explain.executionStats.totalKeysExamined`
Number of index entries scanned. `explain.executionStats.totalKeysExamined` corresponds to the `nscanned` field returned by `cursor.explain()` in earlier versions of MongoDB.

`explain.executionStats.totalDocsExamined`
Number of documents examined during query execution. Common query execution stages that examine documents are `COLLSCAN` and `FETCH`.

`explain.executionStats.totalDocsExamined` refers to the total number of documents examined and *not* to the number of documents returned. For example, a stage can examine a document in order to apply a filter. If the document is filtered out, then it has been examined but will not be returned as part of the query result set.

If a document is examined multiple times during query execution, `explain.executionStats.totalDocsExamined` counts each examination. That is, `explain.executionStats.totalDocsExamined` is *not* a count of the total number of *unique* documents examined.

`explain.executionStats.executionStages`
Details the completed execution of the winning plan as a tree of stages; i.e. a stage can have an `inputStage` or multiple `inputStages`.

Starting in MongoDB 5.1, a stage can have these input stages:

- `thenStage`

- `elseStage`

- `innerStage`

- `outerStage`

Each stage consists of execution information specific to the stage.

`explain.executionStats.executionStages.executionTimeMillisEstimate`
The estimated amount of time in milliseconds for query execution.

`explain.executionStats.executionStages.opens`
Starting in MongoDB 5.1, the number of times a stage was opened during query execution.

`explain.executionStats.executionStages.closes`
Starting in MongoDB 5.1, the number of times a stage was closed during query execution.

`explain.executionStats.executionStages.works`
Specifies the number of "work units" performed by the query execution stage. Query execution divides its work into small units. A "work unit" might consist of examining a single index key, fetching a single document from the collection, applying a projection to a single document, or doing a piece of internal bookkeeping.

This field appears if the operation used the classic query execution engine.

`explain.executionStats.executionStages.saveState`
The number of times that the query stage suspended processing and saved its current execution state, for example in preparation for yielding its locks.

`explain.executionStats.executionStages.restoreState`
The number of times that the query stage restored a saved execution state, for example after recovering locks that it had previously yielded.

`explain.executionStats.executionStages.isEOF`
Specifies whether the execution stage has reached end of stream:

- If `true` or `1`, the execution stage has reached end-of-stream.

- If `false` or `0`, the stage may still have results to return. For example, consider a query with a limit whose execution stages consists of a `LIMIT` stage with an input stage of `IXSCAN` for the query. If the query returns more than the specified limit, the `LIMIT` stage will report `isEOF: 1`, but its underlying `IXSCAN` stage will report `isEOF: 0`.

`explain.executionStats.executionStages.opType`
For operations on time series collections, the type of operation.

`explain.executionStats.executionStages.bucketFilter`
For operations on time series collections, the filter used to reduce the number of buckets queried in the bucket catalog.

`explain.executionStats.executionStages.residualFilter`
For operations on time series collections, the filter used to query the bucket catalog.

`explain.executionStats.executionStages.nBucketsUnpacked`
For operations on time series collections, the number of buckets unpacked to resolve the operation.

`explain.executionStats.executionStages.nMeasurementsDeleted`
For operations on time series collections, the number of documents deleted.

`explain.executionStats.executionStages.nMeasurementsInserted`
For operations on time series collections, the number of documents inserted.

`explain.executionStats.executionStages.nMeasurementsMatched`
For operations on time series collections, the number of documents matched.

`explain.executionStats.executionStages.nMeasurementsModified`
For operations on time series collections, the number of documents modified.

`explain.executionStats.executionStages.nMeasurementsUpserted`
For operations on time series collections, the number of documents upserted.

`explain.executionStats.executionStages.inputStage`
Each `inputStage` can have different fields depending on the value of `inputStage.stage`. The following table describes possible fields and what stages they can appear in.

Each `inputStage` can have another `inputStage` as a field. See Explain Output Structure.

| Field | Description | Applicable Stages |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docsExamined` | Specifies the number of documents scanned during the query execution stage. | `COLLSCAN`, `FETCH` |
| `keysExamined` | For query execution stages that scan an index `keysExamined` is the total number of in-bounds and out-of-bounds keys that are examined in the process of the index scan. If the index scan consists of a single contiguous range of keys, only in-bounds keys need to be examined. If the index bounds consists of several key ranges, the index scan execution process may examine out-of-bounds keys in order to skip from the end of one range to the beginning of the next. | `IXSCAN` |
| `numReads` | The number of documents scanned or index keys examined during the query execution stage. | `COLLSCAN`, `IXSCAN` |
| `seeks` | The number of times that we had to seek the index cursor to a new position in order to complete the index scan. | `IXSCAN` |
| `usedDisk` | Whether the stage wrote to disk. | `GROUP` |
| `spills` | The number of times the stage spilled to disk. | `GROUP`, `SORT` |
| `spilledBytes` | The total amount of data written to disk in bytes. | `GROUP`, `SORT` |
| `spilledRecords` | The total number of individual records spilled to disk. | `GROUP`, `SORT` |
| `spilledDataStorageSize` | The total disk space, in bytes, used by the spilled data. | `GROUP`, `SORT` |
| `peakTrackedMemBytes` | Maximum number of bytes of tracked memory in use by the current query operation. | `GROUP`, `SORT` |
`explain.executionStats.allPlansExecution`
Contains *partial* execution information captured during the plan selection phase for both the winning and rejected plans. The field is present only if `explain` runs in `allPlansExecution` verbosity mode.

`explain.executionStats.operationMetrics`
Contains resource consumption statistics, as long as they are not zero. The field is present only if `explain` runs in `executionStats` verbosity mode or higher and if `profileOperationResourceConsumptionMetrics` is enabled.

MongoDB 8.2 removes `profileOperationResourceConsumptionMetrics`. Therefore, code depending on operationMetrics does not work.

### `serverInfo`

<Tabs>

<Tab name="Unsharded Collections">

For unsharded collections, `explain` returns the following `serverInfo` information for the MongoDB instance:

```javascript
serverInfo: {
   host: <string>,
   port: <int>,
   version: <string>,
   gitVersion: <string>
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab name="Sharded Collections">

For sharded collections, `explain` returns the `serverInfo` for each accessed shard, and a top-level `serverInfo` object for the `mongos`.

```javascript
queryPlanner: {
   ...
   winningPlan: {
      stage: <STAGE1>,
      shards: [
         {
            shardName: <string>,
            connectionString: <string>,
            serverInfo: {
               host: <string>,
               port: <int>,
               version: <string>,
               gitVersion: <string>
            },
            ...
         }
         ...
      ]
   }
 },
 serverInfo: {      // serverInfo for mongos
   host: <string>,
   port: <int>,
   version: <string>,
   gitVersion: <string>
 }
 ...
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

## Execution Plan Statistics for Query with `$lookup` Pipeline Stage

The explain results can include execution statistics for queries that use a `$lookup` pipeline stage. To include those execution statistics, you must run the explain operation in one of these execution verbosity modes:

- executionStats

- allPlansExecution

The following fields are included in the explain results for a `$lookup` query:

```none
'$lookup': {
   from: <string>,
   as: <string>,
   localField: <string>,
   foreignField: <string>
},
totalDocsExamined: <long>,
totalKeysExamined: <long>,
collectionScans: <long>,
indexesUsed: [ <string_1>, <string_2>, ..., <string_n> ],
executionTimeMillisEstimate: <long>
```

To see the descriptions for the fields in the `$lookup` section, see the `$lookup` page.

The other fields are:

`explain.totalDocsExamined`
Number of documents examined during the query execution.

`explain.totalKeysExamined`
Number of index keys examined.

`explain.collectionScans`
Number of times a collection scan occurred during query execution. During a collection scan, each document in a collection is compared to the query predicate. Collection scans occur if no appropriate index exists that covers the query.

`explain.indexesUsed`
Array of strings with the names of the indexes used by the query.

`explain.executionTimeMillisEstimate`
Estimated time in milliseconds for the query execution.

## Execution Plan Statistics for Search Queries

The explain results includes execution statistics for queries that use a `$search`, `$searchMeta`, or `$vectorSearch` pipeline stage. To include execution statistics for search queries, run the `explain` command in one of the following execution verbosity modes:

- executionStats

- allPlansExecution

MongoDB returns execution statistics for search and vector search queries that use the classic engine only.

For more details on search and vector search query explain results, see:

- Explain Search Results

- Explain MongoDB Vector Search Results

## Collection Scan

If the query planner selects a collection scan, the explain result includes a `COLLSCAN` stage.

If the query planner selects an index, the explain result includes a `IXSCAN` stage. The stage includes information such as the index key pattern, direction of traversal, and index bounds.

Starting in MongoDB 5.3, if the query planner selects a clustered index for a clustered collection and the query contains bounds that define the portion of the index to search, the explain result includes a `CLUSTERED_IXSCAN` stage. The stage includes information about the clustered index key and index bounds.

If the query planner selects a clustered index for a clustered collection and the query *does not* contain bounds, the query performs an unbounded collection scan and the explain result includes a `COLLSCAN` stage.

The `notablescan` parameter does not allow unbounded queries that use a clustered index because the queries require a full collection scan.

For more information on execution statistics of collection scans, see Interpret Explain Plan Results.

## Covered Queries

When an index covers a query, MongoDB can both match the query conditions **and** return the results using only the index keys. MongoDB does not need to examine documents from the collection to perform any part of the query.

When an index covers a query, the explain result has an `IXSCAN` stage that is **not** a descendant of a `FETCH` stage.

## `$or` Expression

If MongoDB uses indexes for an `$or` expression, the result will include the `OR` stage with an `explain.queryPlanner.winningPlan.inputStages` array that details the indexes; e.g.:

```javascript
{
   stage: 'OR',
   inputStages: [
      {
         stage: 'IXSCAN',
         ...
      },
      {
         stage : 'IXSCAN',
         ...
      },
      ...
   ]
}
```

In previous versions of MongoDB, `cursor.explain()` returned the `clauses` array that detailed the indexes.

## Aggregation Stages with Spill Metrics

When `explain` is run in either executionStats or allPlansExecution verbosity mode, certain aggregation stages that may spill to disk have additional output. These stages include `$sort`, `$group`, `$setWindowFields`, `$bucketAuto`, `$graphLookup`, and `$lookup` (when using the slot-based execution engine).

| Stage | Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `$sort` | `totalDataSizeSorted` | long | An estimated number of bytes processed in the `$sort` stage. |
| `$sort`, `$group`, `$setWindowFields`, `$bucketAuto`, `$graphLookup`, `$lookup` (SBE only) | `usedDisk` | boolean | Whether the stage wrote to disk. |
| `$sort`, `$group`, `$setWindowFields`, `$bucketAuto`, `$graphLookup`, `$lookup` (SBE only) | `spills` | long long | The number of times the stage spilled to disk. |
| `$sort`, `$group`, `$setWindowFields`, `$bucketAuto`, `$graphLookup`, `$lookup` (SBE only) | `spilledBytes` | long long | An estimate of the number of bytes written to disk before compression. |
| `$sort`, `$group`, `$setWindowFields`, `$bucketAuto`, `$graphLookup`, `$lookup` (SBE only) | `spilledRecords` | long long | The total number of individual records spilled to disk. |
| `$sort`, `$group`, `$setWindowFields`, `$bucketAuto`, `$graphLookup`, `$lookup` (SBE only) | `spilledDataStorageSize` | long long | The total disk space, in bytes, used by the spilled data. |
| `$sort`, `$group`, `$setWindowFields`, `$bucketAuto`, `$graphLookup`, `$lookup` (SBE only) | `peakTrackedMemBytes` | long long | The peak memory usage, in bytes, tracked during stage execution. |

## Sort Stage

If MongoDB cannot use an index or indexes to obtain the sort order, the results include a `SORT` stage indicating an in-memory sort operation. If the explain plan does not contain an explicit `SORT` stage, then MongoDB used an index to obtain the sort order.

## Query Shape Hash

Starting in MongoDB 8.0, `explain` outputs the following field:

`explain.queryShapeHash`
A hexadecimal string that represents the hash of the query shape. For more information, see Query Shapes.
