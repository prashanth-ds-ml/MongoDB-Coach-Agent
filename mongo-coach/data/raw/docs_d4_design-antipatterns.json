The large\narray can exceed the document size limit and cause a decrease in index\nperformance.\nReduce Number of Collections\nYou create a large number of collections in your database. Having too many\ncollections can decrease storage engine performance.\nRemove Unnecessary Indexes\nYour collection contains unnecessary indexes. Unnecessary\nindexes consume additional disk space and can degrade write performance.\nReduce Bloated Documents\nYour collection has excessively large documents. The large documents\ncan degrade the performance of your most common queries.\nReduce $lookup Operations\nYou are running too many $lookup operations on your data. This increases\nquery complexity and reduces query performance.",
