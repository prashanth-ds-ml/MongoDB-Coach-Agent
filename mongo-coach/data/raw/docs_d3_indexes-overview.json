For\nexample, consider the following scenarios:\nA human resources department often needs to look up employees by\nemployee ID. You can create an index on the employee ID field to\nimprove query performance.\nSingle Field Index\nA salesperson often needs to look up client information by\nlocation. Location is stored in an embedded object with fields\nlike state , city , and zipcode . You can create an\nindex on the location object to improve performance for\nqueries on that object.\nWhen you create an index on an embedded document, only queries that\nspecify the entire embedded document use the index. Queries on a\nspecific field within the document do not use the index.\nSingle Field Index on an embedded\ndocument\nA grocery store manager often needs to look up inventory items by\nname and quantity to determine which items are low stock. You can\ncreate a single index on both the item and quantity fields to improve query performance.\nCompound Index",
