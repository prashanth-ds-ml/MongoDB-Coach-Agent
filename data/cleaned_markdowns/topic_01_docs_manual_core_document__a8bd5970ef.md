# Documents

MongoDB stores data records as BSON documents. BSON is a binary representation of JSON documents, though it contains more data types than JSON. For the BSON spec, see bsonspec.org. See also BSON Types.

## Document Structure

MongoDB documents are composed of field-and-value pairs and have the following structure:

```javascript
{
   field1: value1,
   field2: value2,
   field3: value3,
   ...
   fieldN: valueN
}
```

The value of a field can be any of the BSON data types, including other documents, arrays, and arrays of documents. For example, the following document contains values of varying types:

```javascript
var mydoc = {
               _id: ObjectId("5099803df3f4948bd2f98391"),
               name: { first: "Alan", last: "Turing" },
               birth: new Date('Jun 23, 1912'),
               death: new Date('Jun 07, 1954'),
               contribs: [ "Turing machine", "Turing test", "Turingery" ],
               views : Long(1250000)
            }
```

The above fields have the following data types:

- `_id` holds an ObjectId.

- `name` holds an *embedded document* that contains the fields `first` and `last`.

- `birth` and `death` hold values of the *Date* type.

- `contribs` holds an *array of strings*.

- `views` holds a value of the *NumberLong* type.

### Field Names

Field names are strings.

Documents have the following restrictions on field names:

- The field name `_id` is reserved for use as a primary key; its value must be unique in the collection, is immutable, and may be of any type other than an array or regex. If the `_id` contains subfields, the subfield names cannot begin with a (`$`) symbol.

- Field names **cannot** contain the `null` character.

- The server permits storage of field names that contain dots (`.`) and dollar signs (`$`).

- MongodB 5.0 adds improved support for the use of (`$`) and (`.`) in field names. There are some restrictions. See Field Name Considerations for more details.

- Each field name must be unique within the document. You must not store documents with duplicate fields because MongoDB CRUD operations might behave unexpectedly if a document has duplicate fields.

The MongoDB Query Language doesn't support documents with duplicate field names:

- Although some BSON builders may support creating a BSON document with duplicate field names, inserting these documents into MongoDB isn't supported even if the insert succeeds, or appears to succeed.

- For example, inserting a BSON document with duplicate field names through a MongoDB driver may result in the driver silently dropping the duplicate values prior to insertion, or may result in an invalid document being inserted that contains duplicate fields. Querying those documents leads to inconsistent results.

- Updating documents with duplicate field names isn't supported, even if the update succeeds or appears to succeed.

Starting in MongoDB 6.1, to see if a document has duplicate field names, use the `validate` command with the `full` field set to `true`. In any MongoDB version, use the `$objectToArray` aggregation operator to see if a document has duplicate field names.

## Dot Notation

MongoDB uses the *dot notation* to access the elements of an array and to access the fields of an embedded document.

### Arrays

To specify or access an element of an array by the zero-based index position, concatenate the array name with the dot (`.`) and zero-based index position, and enclose in quotes:

```javascript
"<array>.<index>"
```

For example, given the following field in a document:

```javascript
{
   ...
   contribs: [ "Turing machine", "Turing test", "Turingery" ],
   ...
}
```

To specify the third element in the `contribs` array, use the dot notation `"contribs.2"`.

For examples querying arrays, see:

- Query an Array

- Query an Array of Embedded Documents

- [`$[]`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/reference/operator/update/positional-all/#mongodb-update-up.---) all positional operator for update operations,

- [`$[<identifier>]`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/reference/operator/update/positional-filtered/#mongodb-update-up.---identifier--) filtered positional operator for update operations,

- `$` positional operator for update operations,

- `$` projection operator when array index position is unknown

- Query an Array for dot notation examples with arrays.

### Embedded Documents

To specify or access a field of an embedded document with dot notation, concatenate the embedded document name with the dot (`.`) and the field name, and enclose in quotes:

```javascript
"<embedded document>.<field>"
```

For example, given the following field in a document:

```javascript
{
   ...
   name: { first: "Alan", last: "Turing" },
   contact: { phone: { type: "cell", number: "111-222-3333" } },
   ...
}
```

- To specify the field named `last` in the `name` field, use the dot notation `"name.last"`.

- To specify the `number` in the `phone` document in the `contact` field, use the dot notation `"contact.phone.number"`.

Partition fields cannot use field names that contain a dot (`.`).

For examples querying embedded documents, see:

- Query on Embedded/Nested Documents

- Query an Array of Embedded Documents

## Document Limitations

Documents have the following attributes:

### Document Size Limit

The maximum BSON document size is 16 mebibytes.

The maximum document size helps ensure that a single document cannot use an excessive amount of RAM or, during transmission, an excessive amount of bandwidth. To store documents larger than the maximum size, MongoDB provides the GridFS API. For more information about GridFS, see `mongofiles` and the documentation for your driver

### Document Field Order

Unlike JavaScript objects, the fields in a BSON document are ordered.

#### Field Order in Queries

For queries, the field order behavior is as follows:

- When comparing documents, field ordering is significant. For example, when comparing documents with fields `a` and `b` in a query:

  - `{a: 1, b: 1}` is equal to `{a: 1, b: 1}`

  - `{a: 1, b: 1}` is not equal to `{b: 1, a: 1}`

- For efficient query execution, the query engine may reorder fields during query processing. Among other cases, reordering fields may occur when processing these projection operators: `$project`, `$addFields`, `$set`, and `$unset`.

  - Field reordering may occur in intermediate results as well as the final results returned by a query.

  - Because some operations may reorder fields, you should not rely on specific field ordering in the results returned by a query that uses the projection operators listed earlier.

#### Field Order in Write Operations

For write operations, MongoDB preserves the order of the document fields *except* for the following cases:

- The `_id` field is always the first field in the document.

- Updates that include `renaming` of field names may result in the reordering of fields in the document.

### The `_id` Field

In MongoDB, each document stored in a standard collection requires a unique _id field that acts as a primary key. If an inserted document omits the `_id` field, the MongoDB driver automatically generates an ObjectId for the `_id` field.

This also applies to documents inserted through update operations with upsert: true.

In time series collections, documents do not require a unique _id field because MongoDB does not create an index on the `_id` field.

The `_id` field has the following behavior and constraints:

- By default, MongoDB creates a unique index on the `_id` field during the creation of a collection.

- The `_id` field is always the first field in the documents. If the server receives a document that does not have the `_id` field first, then the server will move the field to the beginning.

- If the `_id` contains subfields, the subfield names cannot begin with a (`$`) symbol.

- The `_id` field may contain values of any BSON data type, other than an array, regex, or undefined.

  To ensure functioning replication, do not store values that are of the BSON regular expression type in the `_id` field.

The following are common options for storing values for `_id`:

- Use an ObjectId.

- Use a natural unique identifier, if available. This saves space and avoids an additional index.

- Generate an auto-incrementing number.

- Generate a UUID in your application code. For a more efficient storage of the UUID values in the collection and in the `_id` index, store the UUID as a value of the BSON `BinData` type.

  Index keys that are of the `BinData` type are more efficiently stored in the index if:

  - the binary subtype value is in the range of 0-7 or 128-135, and

  - the length of the byte array is: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 20, 24, or 32.

- Use your driver's BSON UUID facility to generate UUIDs. Be aware that driver implementations may implement UUID serialization and deserialization logic differently, which may not be fully compatible with other drivers. See your driver documentation for information concerning UUID interoperability.

Most MongoDB driver clients include the `_id` field and generate an `ObjectId` before sending the insert operation to MongoDB. However, if the client sends a document without an `_id` field, the `mongod` adds the `_id` field and generates the `ObjectId`.

## Other Uses of the Document Structure

In addition to defining data records, MongoDB uses the document structure throughout, including but not limited to: query filters, update specifications documents, and index specification documents

### Query Filter Documents

Query filter documents specify the conditions that determine which records to select for read, update, and delete operations.

You can use `<field>:<value>` expressions to specify the equality condition and query operator expressions.

```javascript
{
  <field1>: <value1>,
  <field2>: { <operator>: <value> },
  ...
}
```

For examples, see:

- Query Documents

- Query on Embedded/Nested Documents

- Query an Array

- Query an Array of Embedded Documents

### Update Specification Documents

Update specification documents use update operators to specify the data modifications to perform on specific fields during an update operation.

```javascript
{
  <operator1>: { <field1>: <value1>, ... },
  <operator2>: { <field2>: <value2>, ... },
  ...
}
```

For examples, see Update specifications.

### Index Specification Documents

Index specification documents define the field to index and the index type:

```javascript
{ <field1>: <type1>, <field2>: <type2>, ...  }
```
